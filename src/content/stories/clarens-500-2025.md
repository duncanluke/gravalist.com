Immersing into the unknown is a fitting way to kick off 2025, and the Clarens 500 is the latest challenge for those who thrive on adventure. This new route takes riders through Golden Gate Highlands National Park in the Free State of South Africa, tracing the border of Lesotho.

## Clarens 500

A small group of weary yet eager adventurers gathered at the Clarens Monument just before 06:00, each arriving with their own level of preparedness—or lack thereof. With no support, and no prescribed way to tackle it, the only certainty was the need to stay safe, embrace the challenge, and keep moving forward.

_Photo:  Piet, who was eager to charge off the front, couldn’t resist the scenery. He came to a stop, shaking his head in awe. “I had to stop and take pictures. It’s just too beautiful,” he admitted. It was a rare moment where speed took a backseat to appreciation. Out here, racing the clock mattered a little less, and soaking in the sheer grandeur of the land became just as important as the ride itself._

One rider, Jacques, took a particularly nifty approach—“Don’t give a fork” was his mindset, and his aero bars would surely save him some time. The general goal among the riders? A sub-30-hour finish. A bold ambition.

## **A Route Worth Stopping For**

Despite the brutal challenge ahead, the breathtaking landscapes and perfect weather were enough to make even the most competitive riders pause. Rolling golden grasslands, towering sandstone cliffs, and deep valleys stretched endlessly in every direction. The light of the early morning sun painted the mountains in hues of gold and red, a sight so surreal it felt like riding through a painting.

## **The Final Push**

The final 100 km of this course is arguably some of the toughest gravel parcour in South Africa. No obvious refueling points. Just a relentless loop past a Vulture Feeding Viewpoint, followed by an 8 km climb with gradients reaching 12% around the 490 km mark. Sleep deprivation would bring yet another [sense-of-humor check](../../../com/gravalist/stories/the-3-rule-for-building-unsupported-ultra-gravel-bikepacking-routes.html), as the road drags on to a final 300-meter ascent over the last 10 km, leading back to the Clarens Monument.
