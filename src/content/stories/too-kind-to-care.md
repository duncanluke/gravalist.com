"Hey, cycling today?

You'll be all right. Just keep it low," they say. I peer at the falling snow, breakfast warming me in a strange way.

"Stay low?" I ponder, trying to grasp their advice's demand. Another elderly couple gazes outside, lending a hand.

"Driving today? You'll be fine, just..." she begins to inquire, "Do you have a fine car?" their question transpires.

Stumbling, the lone lady replies without boasting, "No car, but shovels and a sleeping bag, we've got the most."

I turn to my bicycle, then back at the snow so pure. In this world of warmth and kindness, I am reassured.
