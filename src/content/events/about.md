Food, drink and belongings must be carried by you or acquired unplanned en route. Accept no help that others couldn't also receive along the way. All forward movement along the course must be self-powered. Drafting is discouraged, except for Groups/Touring.&nbsp; &nbsp; RESPONSIBILITY You are responsible for your safety and logistics. It is compulsory to ride with a satellite tracking unit. Riders must ensure their tracking devices (SPOT or other) are operating correctly at all times. Travel insurance, cycle helmets, and lights are mandatory. You must have valid liability, death, accident and health insurance during the event, covering emergency extraction. Respect and be aware of other road users. Follow local traffic laws. &nbsp; HONOUR The spirit of the race is a commitment to autonomy and self-reliance and the integrity to uphold the values of equality and fair play to test an endeavour truthfully. It is fine to go off course to resupply or for emergency reasons (mechanical or medical). Riders must return to the exact point of departure from the route to recommence their ride and not miss even a meter of the race route. Maintain evidence of your ride.
