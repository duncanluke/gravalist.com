Learn More &nbsp; UNSUPPORTED ULTRACYCLING GRAVEL BIKEPACKING &nbsp; Africa calls to those who crave a journey defined by rugged beauty, self-reliance, and a deeper connection to both the land and its heritage. If you are drawn to the idea of retracing the pioneering spirit of the early settlers, pushing your limits, and rediscovering your roots, TransubAfrica is the adventure you’ve been waiting for. Forget the polished routes of Europe, the neat grids of America, or the manicured paths of Japan. TransubAfrica offers something more raw, more real: a grand tour through the heart of one of the world’s most breathtaking gravel bike packing landscapes. &nbsp; Cape Town to Kenya — around 7,000 km &nbsp; A select group of riders will take on an extraordinary journey of around 4,000 km, starting in Cape Town and traversing several countries before reaching Kenya. This monumental route will take riders through wild and rugged terrain, crossing national borders and immersing them in cultures and landscapes rarely experienced from a bike. &nbsp; We expect riders to take between four - six weeks to complete this epic crossing of Africa. Every day will be an opportunity to test your skills, instincts, and courage on some of the most remote and awe-inspiring routes in the world. &nbsp; Route Planning — You Make it Happen Building and plotting such an ambitious route is an intensive commitment. We pledge to drive the route ourselves to ensure it is safe and well-mapped before riders embark on it. To make this possible, we need&nbsp;paid members to join the waiting list. Your early commitment helps fund our route-scouting expedition, giving us the resources to drive and document every kilometer ahead of you. As a member of the waiting list, you will get exclusive behind-the-scenes content as we build, drive, and map the route, so you can see the adventure taking shape and get inspired long before you clip into your pedals. &nbsp; An Unsupported Challenge TransubAfrica will be fully unsupported and self-sufficient. You’ll be relying on your own skills and grit, with no support crew, no safety net — just you and the open road, navigating a route forged through some of Africa’s most spectacular and challenging landscapes. &nbsp; Much like the great treks of the past, this is about honouring the legacy of explorers who crossed Africa before us. Every pedal stroke will echo with history as you chart your way through diverse regions and environments, testing your body and spirit while connecting to something far greater than a simple finish line. &nbsp; &nbsp; Community, Heritage, and Adventure &nbsp; Don’t think of this as a race,&nbsp;you might pull into a local pub after a brutal day, share a laugh with fellow riders, and savor the hard-earned rewards of self-sufficiency. Like a meditation retreat for the soul, TransubAfrica will push you to your limits and remind you what it means to feel truly alive.
