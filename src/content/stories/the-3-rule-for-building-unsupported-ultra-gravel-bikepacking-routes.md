## **Beyond Distance: The Philosophy of Route Design**

Building a **gravel ultra route** is an art form. It’s more than just connecting dirt roads—it’s about creating a journey that challenges, inspires, and transforms riders. A well-designed route isn’t just about the distance; it’s about **how that distance is experienced**.

The key? **Balancing difficulty, remoteness, and flow** to guide riders through both physical and mental highs and lows.

If you’re looking to design your own **bikepacking ultra experience**, here are some fundamental principles to consider.

## **The 3% Rule: The Core of Gravalist Route Building**

A **Gravalist** route follows a fundamental rule:

> 💡 **Only 3% of the course should be truly tough.**

Why? Because challenge is necessary—but **only in the right dose**. Too much, and it turns into a sufferfest that breaks the spirit. Too little, and it lacks the depth that makes ultra-rides meaningful.

That **3%** is where riders hit their **mental and physical limits**, question their choices, and—if they push through—find something new in themselves.

For **Clarens 500**, the **3% challenge** comes in the **final loops through the National Part**—right after a long, **100km remote section**. Riders can _almost_ see the finish, but it might take **8 more hours** to get there. It’s at this moment that the ride stops being about distance and starts being about **self-discovery**.

### **Tip for Route Designers**

• Keep **97% of the route rideable**, encouraging steady forward motion.

• Make **3% of the route demanding**, ensuring riders dig deep at the right moment.

• The toughest section should come **when fatigue has already set in**, but not so early that it breaks morale.

## **Strategic Town Spacing: The Illusion of Security**

Gravel ultras thrive on a delicate balance of **remoteness and reassurance**. If towns and resupply points are **too close together**, the challenge is diminished. If they’re **too far apart**, riders may break down mentally or struggle to stay safe.

The goal is to **create the illusion of security while keeping it just out of reach**. This is where the magic happens—riders feel alone but **never completely stranded**.

### 🔍 **Clarens 500 Example**

• The **longest gap without a resupply** is 100km—far enough to feel remote but manageable with planning.

• The **last stretch before the finish feels deceptively close**, but exhaustion turns those final kilometers into a battle.

### **Tip for Route Designers**

• Place **towns or resupply points far enough apart** to force self-sufficiency.

• Create **psychological checkpoints**—places where riders think they’re almost done, only to realize they still have hours to go.

• Consider **water and food access** in extreme conditions. A **hidden tap or farm stall** can be the difference between survival and scratching.

## **The Night Ride Factor: Questioning Everything in the Dark**

In **any ultra route over 500km**, most riders will end up **riding through the night**. And that’s where the real test begins.

Riding alone at 2 AM, with nothing but a headlamp and the sound of gravel under your tires, is **where doubts creep in**. It’s the moment when riders **question their decisions, their bodies, and sometimes their sanity**. But it’s also where they **find their limits—and break through them**.

### **Tip for Route Designers**

• **Design night sections to be rideable but mentally challenging.**

• Avoid overly technical terrain in the dark—it’s about endurance, not survival mode.

• If possible, **set up night sections where the only way out is forward** (no easy bailouts).

## **The Psychological Finish Line: The Final Mind Game**

A great route **doesn’t just end—it plays with perception until the very last moment**.

One of the most effective techniques? **Make the finish look close, but feel far.** Riders should feel like they can almost touch the end, but **still have hours of effort ahead**.

### **Clarens 500 Example**

• The final loops through the National Parks brings riders **so close to Clarens** that they can see it in the distance.

• But they still have **significant climbing and tough terrain** before reaching the actual finish.

This is the final **mental battle**—a chance for riders to push through exhaustion and prove something to themselves.

### **Tip for Route Designers**

• **Don’t make the last 20km easy**—this is where the real victory happens.

• Use **false summits, hidden turns, or unexpected climbs** to keep riders engaged until the very last stretch.

• Let the finish be **earned, not given**.

## **Final Thoughts: Designing Routes That Change People**

A **well-designed gravel ultra** isn’t just about distance—it’s about the experience. It should take riders on **a journey through solitude, struggle, and self-discovery**.

A great route **makes people question everything—then come out the other side transformed**.

Whether you’re designing a **personal adventure** or a **mass-start event**, remember:

✔️ **Balance toughness and rideability (3% rule).**

✔️ **Space towns to create a sense of remoteness—but not too much.**

✔️ **Use night riding to push riders beyond comfort.**

✔️ **Design a finish that tests mental resilience.**

What you’re building isn’t just a route—it’s a **story that unfolds over every kilometer**.

So, where will your next ultra take you?
