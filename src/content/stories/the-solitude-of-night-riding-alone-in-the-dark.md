It’s one thing to prepare and pack for an unsupported ultra-cycle race, but it’s another story entirely when you depart from the quiet start line and pedal into your solo 500km cycling adventure. Many Gravalist cyclists choose the solo journey, setting their own goals high and testing the limits of the course. Whether for the personal challenge or to set a course FKT, the choice to go it alone comes with unmatched rewards and undeniable challenges.

For Grant Beringer, riding through the night during the Sedgefield 500 was a profound experience. “The last little bit was in the dark, and on your own, it’s... it’s intense. But that’s what I came for,” he shared. Alone on the gravel roads, illuminated only by his bike light and the stars above, Grant faced a mental game as much as a physical one.

The hours after sunset offer a unique test of character. As the sun sets, casting long shadows across the mountains, solitude deepens, and the continual crunch of gravel becomes the only companion. It’s in these moments that the mind starts to wander: “What’s that sound? Is it a footstep? Was that an owl... or a lion?” For Grant, this quiet isolation was both a challenge and a reward.

500km creates a lot of time to think, and the solitude of night riding has a way of pulling riders back to something primal—something reminiscent of journeys like Dick King’s legendary horse ride. In those days, riders faced wild animals, hostile terrain, and the unknown. Today, while the dangers have lessened, the spirit of the challenge remains. Each turn of the crank brings not just progress but also introspection, as riders confront fears and push beyond their comfort zones.

“The last stretch was a mental game,” Grant admitted. “It’s about psyching yourself up to keep going. But there’s also something magical about being out there, alone in the dark. It’s quiet, the roads are yours, and the stars are incredible. The scenery was the highlight for me—it made it all worth it.”

For some riders, the night is a time for reflection; for others, it’s a battle with doubts and fears as thoughts of the unknown creep in. But that’s the beauty of solo night riding: it pushes you to adapt, to find strength in the silence, and to embrace the adventure in its rawest form. The experience offers a perspective that few others can match. As Grant put it best, “I’ll go back there—it was amazing.”
