From ancient cave dwellings to tales of oceanic activity shaping the mountain ranges, the Cederberg region is steeped in a rich tapestry of cultural heritage and natural wonders.

With its winding switchbacks and breathtaking vistas overlooking the Westwood coast, Dasklip Pass promises to be a highlight or lowlight, of the race Spanning a challenging 520 kilometers with a total elevation gain of 6450 meters, Ceres 500 is not for the faint of heart. But for those brave enough to take on the challenge, the rewards are boundless—stunning scenery, rich cultural heritage, and the exhilarating sense of accomplishment that comes from pushing your limits in the great outdoors. In the 19th century, the Cederberg Mountains attracted a new wave of explorers, including settlers, missionaries, and prospectors, eager to uncover the region's potential for agriculture, mining, and trade. These pioneers braved the rugged terrain and harsh climate of the mountains, establishing settlements and trading posts along the way. During this time, the Cederberg Mountains also became a haven for outlaws and bandits, who sought refuge in the remote valleys and hidden caves of the region. Tales of hidden treasures and secret hideouts only added to the allure of the mountains, attracting adventurers from far and wide. &nbsp; &nbsp; UNSUPPORTED ULTRACYCLING GRAVEL BIKEPACKING 500km.
