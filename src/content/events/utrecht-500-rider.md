If you hear a bus approaching, please pull over and wait for it to pass. Your safety is our priority, so exercise caution on this shared stretch of the route. 2. Hermanus to&amp;nbsp;Stanford&amp;nbsp;- Gravel Riding Tips: On the Hermanus to Stanford stretch, utilize the yellow shoulder, to avoid the fenced side road. Upon leaving Stanford, stick to the gravel on the side of the road, the road can be busy. 3. Bredasdorp to Swellendam - Prepare for Sparsity and Headwinds: The Bredasdorp to Swellendam section can be challenging with sparse resources and potential headwinds. Carry more water than you need, and consult&amp;nbsp;Komoot and google&amp;nbsp;maps for possible resupply points. Don't hesitate to cover some hero miles and extra climbing, and tap into the local knowledge to be resourceful in ensuring a smooth journey. 4. N2 Crossings - Proceed with Caution: a. N2 Crossing #1: Between 297 - 300 KMS, proceed cautiously. b. N2 Crossing #2: Between 370 - 371 KMS, proceed with caution. c. N2 Crossing #3: At 389 KMS, exercise caution. 5. We do not condone Riding on the N2: Riding on the N2 is prohibited, and we do not condone this. Exercise extreme caution at N2 crossings and adhere to all safety protocols to ensure a safe transition. 6. Be Resourceful in Unforeseen Situations: In the event of road obstacles due to weather or unforeseen circumstances, creativity is key. If you find yourself stuck on the route, be resourceful and find innovative ways to overcome challenges. The spirit of adventure lies in embracing the unexpected. Your safety is our utmost concern. Now, gear up, stay vigilant, and pedal with confidence into the thrill of the Franschhoek 500.
