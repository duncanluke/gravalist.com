## Tim's prep looked a little like this

"I Completed the Burra 500 before with my son"

"We’ve moved to George and I would now like to do the Sedgefield 500"  

"I will be turning 72 on the 9th of Sept and would love to start my new year on your race"

## Through the challenges you faced during the ultra-endurance experience, what was the most surprising discovery you made about yourself?

"There’s always more"

In a reflective moment, Tim shared, "A little flask of whiskey and a cigar went with, so I could celebrate my 72nd birthday on Saturday, all by my lonesome self, on a rock, watching the sunset over Africa. A big thank you to the race organizers, it’s a spectacular route and definitely worth an honourable first place on every cyclist’s bucket list."
