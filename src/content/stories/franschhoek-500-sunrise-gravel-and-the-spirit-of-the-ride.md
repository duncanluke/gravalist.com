The [**Franschhoek 500**](../../../com/gravalist/franschhoek-500.html) is an unsupported 500km bikepacking adventure that pushes riders to their limits of endurance, resilience, and planning. This morning, the adventure began with gravel, grit, and a golden sunrise filtering through the misty Franschhoek Pass—a moment of calm before a long day on the trail.

What sets the [**Gravalist unsupported gravel races**](../../../com/gravalist/500-series.html) apart isn’t just the terrain or the distance; it’s the absence of conventional race trappings. No official start line. No banners or countdowns. Riders self-organize, trickling in anywhere from 25 to 5 minutes before starting. Despite the informal setup, there’s a shared sense of purpose—a quiet focus on the challenge that lies ahead.

> Gert, getting into an aero position in Botrivier, shared his determination for this year’s event. “I trained hard this year for this event. Last year’s [Sedgefield 500](../../../com/gravalist/sedgefield-500.html) was tough—it felt like a battle. So I’ve trained more, and I’m aiming to get home before 8 AM tomorrow,” he said. This ambitious goal sets him up for an impressive 26-hour ride time on this demanding course.“The conditions are perfectly in our favor this year,” Gert added, with a sense of optimism that matched the near-perfect weather.

## **A Test of Preparation**

![IMG_5912](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_5912.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_5912.jpg)

> Ian’s brand-new bike turned heads at the start, with its sleek design and the obligatory tape over the front logo—ready to protect against inevitable bike bag bar rub during the long ride. By the time he reaches Van der Stel Pass, just beyond Franschhoek Pass, the tape will likely prove its worth on this demanding journey.

Riders approach this journey in unique ways, each reflecting their personality and experience. Some, like Gert, prepare meticulously. Laughing, he shared how his father, Gert Sr, still insists on writing turn-by-turn directions on paper. “It’s old-school,” Gert admitted, “but it works!”

Others rely on lessons learned the hard way. Piet recalled his last race, saying, “I got lost and had to ride an extra 60km—completely unplanned! Now, I always make sure I have a backup for navigation.

![IMG_6067](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_6067.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_6067.jpg)

> Piet isn’t taking any chances with navigation this year, staying upfront since the start of the Franschhoek 500. Pictured here about halfway through Van der Stel Pass, he’s taking full advantage of the tailwind expected to support riders through the first 250km of the 2024 edition.

Not everyone believes in over-preparing, though. Raymond, reflecting on his approach, said, “I don’t have a plan. With these things, the more you plan, the more can go wrong. I’ll just take it as it comes.” His adaptability is part of his strategy, but as he watched Ian and  Gert Sr crest the first major obstacle of the course, he might have been tempted to rethink his approach.

## **Chasing the Impossible**

This year’s pace is incredible. Riders are pushing harder and faster than ever, with murmurs of breaking the elusive 24-hour barrier—a feat only achieved once in the history of Gravalist 500km races. Whether or not someone accomplishes this today, their determination is inspiring, showcasing the grit and perseverance that define this sport.

## **The Essence of the Journey**

**Franschhoek 500** isn’t just about kilometers or finish times; it’s about discovering personal limits and learning how to navigate them. Some rely on careful planning, while others embrace the unpredictability of the road. Each rider, in their own way, embodies the spirit of adventure and self-reliance that defines unsupported bikepacking.

Perfect conditions allowed riders like Moritz and Maike to chat as they admired the Franschhoek Pass's stunning vistas. Drafting together, they made quick progress toward Hermanus, with the fast 70km descent awaiting them en route to Stanford.

As the day unfolds, the stories of preparation, adaptability, and sheer willpower will shape the journeys of those brave enough to take on the challenge.

The Franschhoek 500 isn’t just about kilometers or finish times; it’s about meeting personal limits and learning to navigate them, whether through careful planning or embracing the chaos of the unknown. Each rider, in their own way, embodies the spirit of adventure and self-reliance that defines unsupported bikepacking.

## Under 24 hours

> ![IMG_6122-2](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_6122-2.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_6122-2.jpg)

> Congratulations to Piet Laubscher for breaking the 24-hour barrier on the [Franschhoek 500](../../../com/gravalist/franschhoek-500.html). His ride showcased the grit, determination, and spirit of ultra-endurance cycling. From seamless resupplies to night riding, to dealing with the unexpected, Piet embodied what this event is all about: discovering your limits and pushing beyond them.

At the finish line, Piet reflected on the journey and shared a glimpse into the unique lifestyle that supports his adventures. His wife chimed in, “Yes, we drove down on Christmas Day, and we’ll be driving back now.” Piet added with a grin, “Yeah, with the trailer, and I’ve got a mattress in the back of my Bakkie, and I sleep there. We take turns driving. We always do it—it’s part of the adventure.”

Piet’s story captures the essence of the unsupported ultra-cycling spirit—not just during the race, but in the way every detail of the journey is woven into the adventure itself.

Along the way, Piet encountered moments that tested his resolve—not just physically, but ethically. “Some friends in the small towns invited me in and wanted me to visit them along the route,” he shared. “But I said, no, no. The rules are strict. I’m following the rules. I’m not allowed to.”

![IMG_6281](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_6281.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_6281.jpg)

This commitment to self-sufficiency underscores the heart of the Franschhoek 500: no comfort, no backup plans, and no shortcuts. It’s all about relying on yourself, your preparation, and your determination to complete the challenge.

![IMG_6306](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_6306.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_6306.jpg)

## **A Finish Line Without the Charade**

At the finish line, Piet’s wife greeted him with a smile, but nothing more was needed. Piet had achieved his own goal, riding the extra kilometers to ensure he met his personal target. He finished all within his goal time. Too often, events try to glorify the individual, turning the finish line into a spectacle of charades. At Gravalist, we encourage riders to dig deeper than that. It’s not about someone saying, “Well done,” or offering applause. It’s about getting through the journey on your own terms. When you achieve it, you can start reflecting on the experience—your experience—rather than having the achievement handed to you by others.

  ![IMG_6128](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_6128.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_6128.jpg)

## **The Race Carries On**

The race doesn’t stop for anyone. Some riders choose to sleep once or twice during the 500km route, knowing the clock keeps ticking. Without external support, riders must make decisions on the fly, with no guarantees that planning ahead will work out.

Ian shared his own experience, explaining that he and three other riders ended up staying at the Malgas Hotel for the night. They set off again at 3:30 AM, knowing a long day lay ahead. However, there’s a downside to such an early start: reaching resupply points before they open.

![IMG_6186](https://gravalist.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Franschhoek%20500%20Photos/2024,%20Franschhoek%20500/IMG_6186.jpg?width=6240&height=4160&name=IMG_6186.jpg)

> “I'm desperate for some proper food though” Ian said as he faced one of the most demanding sections of the course. The rough gravel zigzags relentlessly, mentally taxing riders as they feel like they’re constantly turning away from the next resupply point. At this stage, Ian was still 50km from his next stop, hungry and pushing through one of the course’s toughest stretches.
