This adventure promises solitude, breathtaking rural landscapes, and the challenge of navigating limited resupply points. Below are key highlights and tips to ensure your ride is safe and enjoyable. &nbsp; Route Overview &amp; Key Resupply Points &nbsp; • Fouriesburg (41km) : The first resupply point comes early in your journey. Top up water and snacks here, as the next major resupply point is far away. • Senekal (200km) : This stretch is the longest without resupply, spanning approximately 159km. Be prepared for heat and the need to carry as much as 6 liters of liquid, with electrolytes. • Paul Roux (245km) : Convenience stores here can provide a valuable resupply opportunity. Plan your timing to ensure shops are open when you arrive. • Bethlehem (283km) : A bustling town, especially on Friday evenings. This is a critical resupply point to stock up on food and water for the final remote sections. • Kastell (367km) : Water may be available from local hostels, but food options are limited. Be prepared for sparse resources beyond this point. The final stretch is remote and stunning, providing a rewarding sense of solitude. Ensure you have enough supplies to fuel this part of the journey. &nbsp; Safety &amp; Nutrition Tips &nbsp; 1. Hydration : Always resupply water.
