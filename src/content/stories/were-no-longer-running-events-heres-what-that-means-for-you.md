After careful consideration, we’ve made a clear and intentional decision: **Gravalist will no longer host officially organized events**. Instead, we’re doubling down on what really matters to us — building a platform for **community-driven, self-guided gravel rides**. Need a [refund](https://form.jotform.com/252441025854049)? Simply share your email and we'll process it.

You’re not being downgraded — you’re being migrated immediately into a model that puts freedom, challenge, and connection front and center. No frills. No false promises. Just great riding.

## What’s Changing?

We are no longer:

-   Hosting staffed or organized events.
    
-   Managing logistics or running formal start lines.
    

We are now focused on (coming soon):

-   Curated gravel routes you can ride any time, with community start dates for routes (all self managed).
    
-   A leaderboard to track your efforts and connect with other riders.
    
-   A community platform designed for sharing, motivation, and independent adventure.

## Why We’re Making This Shift

To put it plainly: **formal events aren’t where our energy is best spent**. We don’t have the sponsorship support to do them well, and more importantly, we don’t believe that top-down, staff-heavy events are the future of gravel riding.

Gravalist was never about ticking boxes or running a tight race schedule. It’s about exploration, autonomy, and connecting with people who love the ride. This new model is leaner, more authentic, and better aligned with the way we want to build this community.

## Already Signed Up Expecting an Event?

If you bought in expecting a staffed or officially organized event — and that’s a dealbreaker for you — [we’re offering a full refund](https://form.jotform.com/252441025854049). No friction. Just let us know, and we’ll sort it out.

But if you’re still keen to ride, track your times, and be part of something evolving and self-driven — we’d love for you to stay.

## What’s Next?

We’re continuing to improve the 100% unsupported experience — more routes, smarter tools with better systems and platforms, and stronger community connections are all in the pipeline.

Thanks for being part of the ride so far. We believe this shift to a community model is just the beginning of something more sustainable, more free, and more fun.
