He bartered with them, exchanging goods from distant lands for essential supplies. Samuel's charismatic demeanor and genuine curiosity earned him the trust of the indigenous people, who shared stories of their traditions and the challenges of life in the mountains. Eventually, after days of challenging travel, Samuel emerged on the other side of Naudes Nek Pass, greeted by a breathtaking panorama of the Eastern Cape's vast landscapes.
