###  Welcome to Burra 500

Your gravel journey will begin Pietermaritzburg, known for its picturesque gardens and historical architecture. From there, riders will make their way through the rolling hills and lush greenery of the surrounding countryside, embarking on a challenging yet rewarding adventure.

The undulating terrain offers cyclists an exhilarating experience as they ascend and descend through breathtaking scenery. Venturing through the valleys of the Midlands, riders will encounter quaint towns and villages, immersing themselves in the rich culture and warm hospitality of the locals.

A notable highlight of the route is the ascent of the Drakensberg Mountains, a formidable challenge that will test riders' strength and endurance. However, the panoramic vistas of the mountain range and surrounding valleys promise to be a spectacular reward for their efforts.

As participants loop back towards Pietermaritzburg, they'll carry with them the sense of accomplishment that comes with completing one of the country's most demanding cycling events.
