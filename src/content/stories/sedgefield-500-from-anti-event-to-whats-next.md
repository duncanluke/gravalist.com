Gravel riding has never been about fanfare. It’s about the solitude of a mountain pass at sunrise, the silence of a forest road, and the challenge of pushing yourself further than comfort allows. That’s what **Gravalist** stands for—gravel at its purest. No frills, no banners, no timing chips. The less you expect, the more you experience.

This year, the **Sedgefield 500** took that philosophy to the extreme. We told the handful of riders willing to take it on: _there is no event._ The route exists—go ride it. The story is yours. And they did. Some rolled out at 4am, climbing the Outeniqua Pass as dawn cracked. Others started later, determined to reel them in. Forest tracks, quiet gravel roads, Seven Passes just barely open—it was a ride written in grit and silence.

But here’s the twist: this was never meant to end here. One of the riders who took it on this year has already stepped up to grow the **Sedgefield 500** into something bigger. The seed has been planted. What started as an experiment in gravel purity is now set to evolve—something with traction, something that could become one of world's defining gravel endurance rides. Next year, the **Sedgefield 500** won’t just be a hidden gem whispered about by purists. It’s going to be something special—still raw, still true to gravel, but with more people sharing the adventure, more stories being written, and a chance for this ride to stand on its own as a landmark in the gravel community.

The roads are already there. The spirit is already alive. Now it’s time to see how far this idea can go.

### **Ben’s Ride**

Ben left at 6am. By sunset, we caught him eating a garage pie — the warm meal he’d been waiting for all day. Then he pushed straight through the night, chasing an 8am finish of 510km.

### **David’s Decision**

David’s plan was bold: finish in 26 hours. But at 180km, reality hit. The numbers didn’t add up. An hour later, he booked a hotel. Sometimes the hardest ride is knowing when to stop — and that too is part of the story.

### **Paul’s Push**

Paul carried on. Through the rain, still pushing. Just 20km from the finish, he stopped for pizza — fuel for the final stretch. Then back on the bike, rolling into Sedgefield with nothing but the satisfaction of knowing he’d made it all the way.
