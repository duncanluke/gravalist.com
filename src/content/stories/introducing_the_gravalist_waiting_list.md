We at the Gravalist are excited to introduce a new system designed to enhance your entry experience: the Waiting List.

Given the high demand and the select number of spots available for each event, entries will now open three months prior to each event date. To ensure you don't miss out on your favorite gravel adventures, we've implemented the Waiting List system for all our events.

### How It Works

The Waiting List allows interested riders to add their names for the specific events they wish to participate in. When the event entries open, those on the waiting list will receive the first option to secure their spot before entries go live to the general public, via email. This system ensures that our dedicated community of Gravalists has the best chance of participating in the events they love.

### Why Join the Waiting List?

1.  **Priority Access**: Get the first opportunity to secure your spot before the general public.
2.  **Stay Updated**: Receive timely notifications about entry openings and event details.
3.  **Plan Ahead**: Organize your schedule knowing you have a better chance to participate in your favorite events.

### Upcoming Events

We have a lineup of exciting events coming up, each offering unique experiences and breathtaking landscapes. Riders can choose to race or tour these events, catering to both competitive spirits and those seeking a more leisurely exploration.
